## 🛡️ Undetected & Safe (If Used Right)

The RoE Aimbot uses stealth injection and bypass tech to stay under the radar. Still, don’t go full rage mode in every public match if you want to avoid suspicion. Use legit settings like:

* Low FOV (5–8°)
* Smooth aim
* Chest targeting
* Toggle key

Play smart, stay off radar, and still **wreck the lobby**.
